# Yet Another Bootloop Protector.
- This module try to protect your device from bootloops and system ui failures caused by Magisk/KernelSU/APatch Modules.

## Installation

- Flash it in `Magisk`,`KSU` or `Apatch`
- if you flash it in `custom recovery` , it will disable all the magisk/KSU/APatch modules for no reason. Flash it in `TWRP` only when necessary.


 ### Bootloop

- If a bootloop is detected, , it will automatically disable every Magisk/KSU/APatch module and set the permissions of all general scripts (scripts placed in `/data/adb/service.d` and `/data/adb/post-fs-data.d`) to 644

- You can manually enable each module, or you can use the action button. Using the action button will also set executable permissions `chmod +x` for all general scripts


##  Recovery
- Flashing this module in `TWRP` or `custom recoveries` will automatically disable all Magisk/KSU/APatch modules and general scripts. Your data partition should be accessible otherwise, it won't work.

- It may not work with all recoveries.



## How does it work?
• Each time the device fails to complete the boot, the module creates a "marker"
- No marker files: it creates the first marker (marker1).
- One marker file: it creates a second marker (marker2).
- Two marker files: it creates a third marker (marker3).
- When three markers are present, the module considers the device to be in a boot loop , and  it disables all Magisk modules by creating a disable file in each module's folder. This action prevents those modules from loading during the next boot, which may help the device boot correctly.
- The module waits for the boot to complete, checking every 5 seconds.
If the boot does not complete within a set timeout period (2 minutes by default), the module assumes there is a boot problem, disables all Magisk modules and general scrips, and reboots the device.

## SystemUI Monitor (optional)

- some modules, especially `customization modules`, may sometimes cause SystemUI to crash. Enabling this could help in tracking and resolving such issues.
- You will be prompted to disable or enable system ui monitor while installing the module.
- if enabled , then The Module checks the status of the SystemUI process every 5 seconds.
- If SystemUI is not running, the module starts tracking it and if SystemUI remains inactive for more than 40 seconds, the module assumes a failure of the device and it `disables` all the magisk modules and general scripts and triggers a `reboot`
- To  `disable` the systemUi Monitor , you can create a file named `systemui.monitor.disable` in `/data/adb` or you can just run
```
su -c touch /data/adb/systemui.monitor.disable
```
to `enable` the systemui monitor , you can just remove that file, or you can run , (changes will take place after the next boot)
```
su -c rm -f /data/adb/systemui.monitor.disable
```

- Logs of this module will be found at `/data/local/tmp/service.log`
- you can run `rm -f /data/local/tmp/service.log` to clear the logs.


### Limitations 

- If the cause of the bootloop is not related to Magisk/KSU/APatch modules, this module won't help.
- If any modules directly modify system files, this module won't help.
- In cases where a module uses an incompatible `system.prop` or causes a bootloop during the early boot stages (post-fs-data), this module may not be able to disable it in time.

> In these cases , you can always flash it in TWRP to disable Modules
